# Airbnb Bangkok Data Analysis

## **Business Background**

Airbnb offers a platform for property owners to rent out their accommodations to a global audience. In Bangkok, the platform is popular among tourists seeking a range of experiences from budget to luxury stays. The city's rich cultural heritage and vibrant neighborhoods attract diverse travelers, making it essential for hosts to strategically position their listings to capture demand.

## **Business Problem**

Bangkok hosts face challenges in understanding the determinants of high booking rates and guest satisfaction. The diverse nature of the city's neighborhoods and the varying characteristics of listings make it difficult for hosts to identify which factors most effectively attract bookings and positive reviews. Additionally, hosts need to adapt to seasonal fluctuations in demand to maintain high occupancy rates year-round.

## **Problem Formulation and Objectives**

### Problem Formulation
Despite the success of Airbnb in Bangkok, new hosts face challenges in determining the optimal pricing, minimum nights, and room types for their listings to maximize occupancy and revenue. To help new hosts make informed decisions and succeed in a competitive market, it's essential to provide tailored recommendations based on the geographical areas within the city.

### Analysis Objectives
The analysis of the Airbnb Bangkok Dataset aims to address these problems through the following questions:
1. What are the optimal pricing strategies for different room types in each geographical area (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3)?
2. What are the recommended minimum night stays for listings in different geographical areas?
3. Which room types are most in demand in each geographical area, and how can hosts leverage this information?

### Key Arguments
Understanding pricing and room type preferences by area:
1. By analyzing the distribution and proportion of room types and prices in each area, we can provide recommendations on the most popular and profitable room types and pricing strategies for hosts. This will help hosts to align their offerings with market demand, thereby increasing their occupancy rates and revenues.

Optimal minimum night stays:
2. Determining the appropriate minimum night stays for different areas can help hosts balance between longer bookings and flexibility, maximizing both occupancy and revenue.

## **Conclusions and Recommendations**

After conducting a thorough analysis of Airbnb data in Bangkok, including recommendations on pricing, room types, and the influence of reviews, here are the conclusions and recommendations that can help hosts open new listings in various areas:

### Recommendations

1. **Pricing:**
   - Hosts should set prices within the recommended ranges based on area and room type to ensure competitive pricing that can attract guests.
   - Consider increasing prices during December and other high-review months to capitalize on increased demand.

2. **Room Type Selection:**
   - In Level 1 and Level 2, focus on providing Entire home/apt as the first choice and Private room as the second choice.
   - At Level 3, focus on providing Private rooms as the first choice and Entire home/apt as the second choice.

3. **Minimum Night Stays Strategy:**
   - **Level 1:** Prioritize Short-stays (≤7 nights). Alternative: Long-stays (15-30 nights).
   - **Level 2:** Prioritize Short-stays (≤7 nights). Alternative: Long-stays (15-30 nights).
   - **Level 3:** Prioritize Short-stays (≤7 nights). Alternative: Long-stays (15-30 nights).

4. **Review Quality Improvement:**
   - Ensure that the listing is always in the best condition and provides a satisfying experience for guests to increase the number and quality of reviews.
